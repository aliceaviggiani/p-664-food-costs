# What is the best source of protein for me? The nutritional and environmental cost of foods
## Data visualizations about the environmental costs of protein-rich foods

### 1. Description
What are the differences in the environmental costs of greenhouse gas emissions, water wasted,
and land use among protein-rich foods from animal, dairy, and plant-based sources, and how can
we clearly represent these variations through data visualizations?

Nowadays, the search for protein-rich foods is on the prescription of many fitness and
muscle-building diets. But what else are we consuming along with these proteins? The idea of
these charts is to support us in making a more holistic decision about the food we eat by
measuring nutritious qualities beyond the protein, along with their impacts on the environment in
their production.
