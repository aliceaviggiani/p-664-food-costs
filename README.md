# What is the best source of protein for me? The nutritional and environmental cost of foods 

### 1. Description
Data visualizations about the environmental costs of protein-rich foods. 
The project aim to relate data from foods' nutrients with their impact in the environment, measuring greenhouse gas emissions, wasted water, and land use in the production. 


### 2. Statement
What are the differences in the environmental costs of greenhouse gas emissions, water wasted,
and land use among protein-rich foods from animal, dairy, and plant-based sources, and how can
we clearly represent these variations through data visualizations?

Nowadays, the search for protein-rich foods is on the prescription of many fitness and
muscle-building diets. But what else are we consuming along with these proteins? The idea of
these charts is to support us in making a more holistic decision about the food we eat by
measuring nutritious qualities beyond the protein, along with their impacts on the environment in
their production.


### 3. Workflow
To realize this project, it will be necessary to: 1. Gather data from the food nutrients and qualities,
as well as data on their environmental costs; 2. Clean and manage each of the data sets
separately; 3. Select meaningfully the foods to be worked with, considering protein value, balance
among categories, raw ingredients, and, mainly, that which coincides in both data sets; 4. Merge
both data sets, creating adequate matches among the foods; 5. Create a series of static graphs
that support average peopleâ€™s decisions about their meal decisions, while working with tangible
measures and dimensions of those foods; 6. Export the vector files.

The project will be executed in two stages: first, gathering and managing data, and,
second, producing the visualizations. The Pandas library will be used for data manipulation. And
for the charts, a few libraries will be explored, such as matplotlib, which produces static visuals,
seaborn, built on top of Matplotlib, and plotly, in order to publish on the web.
